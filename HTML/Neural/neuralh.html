            In a science fiction Star Wars universe, machines and automated robots have the strange ability to recognize faces and vehicles, understand language, and predict viable solutions. 
             A while ago, I found myself wondering if it is possible to create the stereotypical intelligent sci-fi robot, and so I began to research computer vision -- this awesome branch 
             of programming that gives a computer human intelligence and instincts to see, identify and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide an appropriate
              output. After days of delving into computer vision research, I accidently stumbled upon neural networks, this extremely complicated function that allotts machines the 
              capability to “see”. Enticed, I rummaged through about a 100 computer vision courses, youtube series, and research papers, to understand how neural networks enable machines to 
              see, only to finally understand that the concept of machines learning human intelligence was not at all the imaginative futuristic impossible program that I had always believed.
               In reality, the programs that make RD2 and C3PO intelligent really just come down to some calculus and intermediate programming skills.

            But that’s not to say neural networks still aren’t awesome. I think that, regardless of the method, there will always be something magical and not so straight-forwardly
             mathematic about machines having human capabilities. So for those of you who are interested in computer vision, welcome to the first installment of this very exciting neural
              network series. There are plenty of neural network courses from youtubers such as Sentdex and Michael Nielson on building neural network datasets and this course will build 
              upon those courses by diving into the monstrous deed of creating a completely original neural network from scratch. Over the past 5 months, I have thrown my weekends away to
               developing, from scratch, one original neural network: a model that recognizes American Sign Language hand gestures and outputs the interpretation of those hand gestures. To 
               further understand how neural networks work and how to construct them, I have supplemented my experimentation with tutorials, among which the major contributors were youtuber 
               Sentdex, Andrew Ng’ Convolutional Neural Network’s course, and Michael Neilson’s Introduction to Neural Networks, and all learners are highly encouraged to check out these 
               courses.
